# GUI Explorations for the Rust DAW
The Rust reference DAW will need a UI. In this DAW we are gathering requirements for that UI and developing a prototype. 

## Purpose of this Repo
This repo is for the following:
+ UX requirements.
+ GUI design & wireframes.
+ Prototype code
+ Benchmarks from other DAWS. These can be:
  + Examples to Follow
  + Examples to Ignore

## Using This Repo
New user stories and benchmarks should be added using issues. 

Requirements can also be added as issues, but user stories are the preferred process.

### Adding User Stories
User stories should use the [user story template](https://github.com/RustyDAW/gui-explorations/issues/1).

### Benchmarks
Benchmarks should follow this template:
TODO

## DAW UX Priorities

### Primary UX Priorities
This DAW must:

+ Be Easy to Learn

### Secondary UX Priorities

+ Be Flexible
+ Be Intuitive
