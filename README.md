# GUI Explorations
This repo is where all requirements gathering and design work for the GUI lives. Actual work on the DAW will go elsewhere. All code in this repo is prototype quality only.

## Purpose
This repo is for the following:
+ UX requirements such as personas, scenarios and user stories.
+ GUI design & wireframes
+ Prototype Code
+ Benchmarks from other DAWS. These can be:
  + Examples to Follow
  + Examples to Ignore

## Issues
Templates for all these issues should be followed (templates TODO)

Issues should be raised for the following:
+ User Stories (these have a template which should be followed). See TODO.
+ UX issues with the prototypes.
+ Design issues with the prototypes.
+ Benchmarks, good or bad.

## UI Features
The following features have been identified to work on initially:
+ Timeline
+ Mixer
+ Effects Chains
+ Piano Roll

These Features will also be needed:
+ Transport Bar
+ Media Bin
+ Global Standards for UI, widgets, controls, errors, etc
+ Routing UI

These features are desired, but not required at launch:
+ Ableton SessionView/Clip Launcher
+ Step Sequencer
+ Advanced Midi Editing/Generating Tools
+ Audio Editing
+ BitWig/FL Studio Audio Design
+ Samplers, Synths, etc...
+ Music Notation Editor (like Reaper)
+ Scripting (e.g. JSFx/ReaScript in Reaper)
+ Templates and macros (e.g. Reaper)
+ audio stretch/time stretching.

Possible other features:
+ Tracker interfaces?

## Functionality to Address
We wish to address the following functionality (some of these will not be addressed in initial release):
+ time signature changes
+ tempo ramping.
+ Supporting microtonal music
+ Folders/Subgroups for tracks (like Reaper)

## Why does this DAW Exist
Currently we need to address for a user why would the use this DAW rather than one of the free (e.g. Ardour) or cheap (Reaper) Daws that exist?

+ What does this DAW do differently from other DAWs?
+ Who is this DAW for?
+ Which users do we not care about?

While we may just be doing this DAW because it's cool, or because everything should be Rust, this is unlikely to result in something that anyone else cares about.

If you were to describe this DAW in one sentence what would that sentence be? If you were to persuade your friend to use it what would you tell them?

## Possible Reasons for this DAW
+ Support for microtonal music, or non western music is poor.
+ There is not a good free DAW that supports making electronic, or composed music.
+ It's 2020 - why do we have DAWs from the last century still?
+ Reaper is wonderful, but it's UI/UX sucks.
+ Existing DAWs are too complex
+ Are there new technologies (MIDI 2.0) that we can build upon?
+ Can we make it easier to compose music
+ Your idea could totally go here...
